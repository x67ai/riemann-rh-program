# RH Program — Session Log (append-only)

Chronological journal of the research program. One entry per working session. Never edit past entries; append corrections as new entries. STATUS.md is the always-current dashboard; this file is the historical record — when they disagree, this file explains why.

## Session 1 — 2026-08-11

**Focus:** Program launch. Ingest the zeta-2/3 artifact (paper + condensed + 95-page transcript + 103k-line Lean repo), establish state of the art, launch design phase.

**Done:**
- Phase 1 (Understand): 6-agent deep-read → `results/full-map.md`, `results/map-hooks.txt`. All 135 PDF pages extracted to `sources-extracted/`.
- Phase 2 (Literature): 12-front web reconnaissance → `results/literature.md`.
- Verified key numerics in Wolfram (Montgomery–Taylor constant, payoff curve λ≤1, two-moment cap 0.8453, HL*(4)→13/18 chain). Recorded in STATUS.md.
- Phase 3 (Design) launched: 8 designers (Tracks A1–A4, B1–B4), then +2 (Track C1–C2) after sponsor directive.
- Durable archive created (`rh-program/`), persistent memory pointer written.

**Decisions:**
- Two-track → three-track structure. Sponsor directive (recorded in STATUS.md): prioritize wholly new machinery (Tracks B/C); Track A reframed as instruments + specification-writing + proportion progress, not a competing bet on deciding RH with existing tools. Rationale: the repo formalizes its own no-go theorems; campaign post-mortem shows ~30 refuted routes all collapsing to Weil positivity; DH/Epstein filter implies the missing input is structural.
- Canonized the new-machinery specification S1–S5 in STATUS.md; every future design brief must cite it.
- Payoff-curve caveat: the unconstrained cosine-window formula is valid only for λ ≤ 1 (and ≲ π/√2); paper's 1.70→90% uses the constrained problem — use paper numbers beyond the band.

**New artifacts:** `STATUS.md`, `LOG.md` (this file), `results/{full-map.md, map-hooks.txt, literature.md}`, `sources-extracted/` (135 files), memory file `rh-research-program.md`.

**Open at close:**
- RUNNING: rh-design (8 designers), task wd7790w3z, run wf_30287ea4-643 — journal under `~/.claude/projects/-Users-jaytyagi-Documents-Work-2026-Math-riemann-anthropic/e8c24f5f-4faf-41e1-962d-7ba16dbd457a/subagents/workflows/wf_30287ea4-643/journal.jsonl`.
- RUNNING: rh-design-supplement (2 Track-C designers), task w4dxvhdce, run wf_2d492d18-6bd — journal `.../wf_2d492d18-6bd/journal.jsonl`.
- When they land: save all 10 proposals to `results/design-proposals.json`, create `directions/` files, update STATUS.md, append Session-1 addendum or Session-2 entry.

**Next session should (if this session ends before the workflows do):** follow STATUS.md "How to resume" step 2 — recover the 10 proposals from the two journals, then run Phase 4 (adversarial verification).

### Session 1 close — 2026-08-11 ~14:10 (user-requested pause)

**State at close:** Phases 1-2 ✅. Phase 3: 9/10 proposals done and durable (A4:lindelof-lock designer stopped mid-run, must re-run). Phase 4: launched then stopped ~12 min in, 0 verdicts journaled — relaunch from `scripts/rh-verify-wf_eb8254d0-341.js`. Phase 5 not started.

**Session-1 headline findings (beyond the phase artifacts):**
1. The zeta-2/3 artifact formalizes its own no-gos: two-moment certificates cap at 0.845 at ANY bandwidth; bandwidth-1 ceiling 0.6818; certificate cannot distinguish on-line double from off-line pair. All proportion progress must enter through one lemma chain (O1_bound → prop_PP → tr2); full RH cannot enter through this machinery at all (DH/Epstein filter).
2. Specification S1-S5 for new machinery canonized (STATUS.md).
3. INDEPENDENT CONVERGENCE: both Track-C designers, briefed differently, converged on Λ(n) ≥ 0 pointwise (positive prime measure) as the overlooked S1 input — violated by Davenport-Heilbronn, invisible to all L²-mean-value machinery. C1 = tilted reflection positivity ladder quasi-RH(a) with Krein-Langer multiplicity-visible indices (conf 0.6); C2 = explicit-formula conservation-law system with defect-cost rigidity (conf 0.55). B3 (tilt-jets arithmetic de Branges, conf 0.8) lands in the same basin from the B-track brief — three of ten designers, mutually blind.
4. Wolfram-verified: c₁* = 0.75329607, Thm D = 0.6725007; support targets 1.043→70%, 1.265→80% reproduced; 1.70→90% needs the constrained (CCLM17) problem; two-moment cap 2−2/√3 = 0.84530; HL*(4) chain 5/36 → 31/36 → 13/18 exact.

**Next session:** follow STATUS.md "PAUSED ... Resume actions" 1-5 verbatim.
