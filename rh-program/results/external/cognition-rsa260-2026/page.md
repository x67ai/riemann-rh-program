Over the past few weeks, the Cognition research team and I have been optimizing our job scheduler to better use disaggregated compute. As a proof of concept, and because I’ve enjoyed factoring numbers as a hobby for the past ten years or so, I drove a bevy of Devins to obtain a factorization of [RSA-260](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-260). In order to do this, my Devins built the world's highest-performance GPU lattice siever, which enables factoring numbers at 10x lower cost than the previous public state of the art. Here is the factorization:

```

RSA-260 (a 260 digit number) sets a new record for the largest publicly solved [RSA Factoring Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge) problem, which benchmarks the feasibility of breaking the [RSA cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem). The previous record, RSA-250, was [set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06197) in February 2020. For reference, state-of-the-art RSA public keys contain 2048 bit (~617 digit) factoring problems, while 1024-bit (~309 digit) RSA was deprecated in 2013.

Below I’ll give some details about how this was accomplished, but here are two important takeaways:

- Hyperscalers or frontier AI labs could likely factor RSA-1024 numbers at a cost on the order of $30 million per number — and, with a bit more optimization, likely substantially less. On the other hand, RSA-2048 remains roughly a billion times harder than RSA-1024 and does not appear to be meaningfully affected by this work.

- Devin is a sufficiently powerful software engineer to solve a challenging problem at the intersection of computational number theory and GPU performance engineering. My role was primarily to set priorities, establish benchmarks, and recognize when work was going off-track. Devin otherwise autonomously handled measurements, cluster operations, and optimization end-to-end. This substituted for what would likely have been a multi-month effort by a team of highly specialized domain experts.


In conclusion, the barrier to entry for cryptanalytic work, other computational mathematics more broadly, and likely most large-scale scientific computing research, is far lower than it used to be. Exciting work beckons anywhere programming can be used to solve a research problem; I encourage all to be ambitious and explore what autonomous software engineering agents can do when applied to these fields!

## [How did this happen?\#](https://cognition.com/blog/factoring-rsa-260\#how-did-this-happen)

Contrary to some [circulating](https://x.com/_seanyneutron/status/2095391516504244480) [claims](http://x.com/penlume/status/2095429389660164463), I did not factor RSA-260 by guessing and checking 130-digit prime numbers by hand. Cognition also has not yet built a multi-thousand-qubit quantum computer. RSA-260 was factored by a new implementation of the [general number field sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve) (GNFS) for GPUs, prepared and run using Devin. GNFS is the most efficient algorithm known for (most) numbers above roughly 100 digits in size and was used in [previous record-breaking RSA number factorizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06197).

The implementation was a significantly modified [CADO-NFS](https://cado-nfs.gitlabpages.inria.fr/). I report essentially no algorithmic advancements — implementing lattice sieving and sparse linear system solving on GPUs required only “good old performance engineering” to take advantage of the preposterous memory systems of the GPU.

## [Cost estimates\#](https://cognition.com/blog/factoring-rsa-260\#cost-estimates)

In total, I estimate that this factorization cost about 4,900 GPU-days, or 13.5 GPU-years, which is about $400k at current market prices. In more detail, modern GNFS implementations consist of a few stages run sequentially: polynomial selection, lattice sieving, and linear system solving. The time breakdown was:

- 643 GPU-days in polynomial selection (this is anomalously high basically due to operator incompetence)

- 3,813 GPU-days sieving

- 467 GPU-days linear system solving (of which about 7% failed to make progress due to crashes or preemption by more important work)


I did this as a side project using a single-digit percentage of our cluster, in the course of optimizing our job scheduler to improve allocations to use disaggregated compute. What does this mean for larger RSA instances?

RSA-1024 is equivalent to 309 digits; according to standard GNFS scaling this is merely 78x more computation than RSA-260. I estimate the cost of factoring RSA-1024 at market GPU prices to be roughly $30M, which can [trade off](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1000) against wall clock time. I know for a fact that the current implementation remains significantly suboptimal; I would not be surprised if moderate further work could reduce the cost of factoring RSA-1024 by another multiple of 2.

Of course, **the fact that RSA-1024 is insecure is not news.** There was speculation that the NSA might have the capability to do RSA-1024 economically as early as the mid-2000s (see e.g. [TWIRL](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45146-4_1) or the [Bernstein matrix machine](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/analysis-of-bernsteins-factorization-circuit/)). Instead, as we describe below, the main developments are (1) a potentially lower cost (in dollars and time) for the factorization, (2) potentially more parties capable of performing the factorizations (you just need enough GPUs rather than making specialized hardware), and (3) **the relative ease with which non-cryptographers can now work on speeding up factoring**.

Finally, I emphasize that the efficiency gains have little impact on the feasibility of factoring RSA-2048-sized numbers with GNFS.

## [Factoring on spare compute\#](https://cognition.com/blog/factoring-rsa-260\#factoring-on-spare-compute)

The factorization ran at no marginal cost on spare or fragmented compute that couldn’t be used for other purposes. Why does this compute exist?

The clusters we use for LLM training and inference contain [NVL72](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb300-nvl72/) racks, each nominally comprising 18 computers interconnected by fast NVLink. LLM workloads use groups of computers within single racks in order to take advantage of this fast interconnect. The job scheduler must solve a constrained optimization problem to pack workloads into racks. In this global allocation, some racks may end up with an idle node or two; sometimes jobs request spare nodes to accommodate failover, or jobs might need even numbers of computers on a rack that has only 17. For us, these inefficiencies amount to a single-digit percentage of overall compute.

To make use of this spare compute, as a first step, I rigged our job scheduler to fill single-node jobs around other workloads at bottom priority. However, we also lacked a consistent source of readily preemptible single-node workloads. Naturally, at this point I thought of lattice sieving, which is a perfect fit for this situation.

[Lattice sieving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_sieving) is embarrassingly parallel over billions of small work units, can make progress using single nodes at a time, and is safe to preempt instantly. It is also the most computationally expensive part of GNFS, so getting sieving done is a lot of progress toward a factorization. However, all prior public GNFS factorization records used only CPUs for lattice sieving; indeed, due to challenges of efficiently implementing lattice sieving on GPUs, for a long time it was not clear that GPU lattice sieving could be more cost-effective overall.

In short, all that I was missing was a sufficiently high-performance GPU lattice siever that could accept the parameters needed to factor RSA-260. So, what did I do? Ask Devin.

## [Using Devin to optimize GNFS\#](https://cognition.com/blog/factoring-rsa-260\#using-devin-to-optimize-gnfs)

At August 13th 0:11:58 Pacific time I aimed Devin at producing a drop-in replacement for `las`, the CPU lattice siever of CADO-NFS. Here is the prompt I used:

> CADO-NFS is FOSS software for performing GNFS. I'd like you to develop a fast GPU lattice siever. This has historically been difficult with present techniques because optimizations for CPU lattice sieving employ a lot of conditional branching and complex memory access patterns, and the intersection of GPU kernel-writing experts and number field theory experts is quite small. However, the higher total memory bandwidth available in a GPU promises a higher performance ceiling. And that intersection now contains you.You have Modal access keys available that I authorize you to use to spin up a single GPU box for performance testing. Obtain the CUDA toolchain etc. and build locally; use GPU only for performance testing and shut it down between measurements.The resultant GPU lattice siever should be a drop-in replacement for the siever step of CADO-NFS. Iterate until you exceed the performance of the CPU lattice siever.

Two hours later I added that `glas` (GPU `las`, of course) should be able to handle the parameters used for RSA-250. Then I went to bed. I woke up to find that, after another 7 hours of iteration, Devin had succeeded.

Over the subsequent week I drove Devin to optimize lattice sieving, then the rest of the GNFS pipeline. First, I will give a high-level description of our GNFS optimizations, and then I will describe the optimization workflow.

### GNFS optimizations (high-level)

At a high level, GNFS consists of a number of stages run sequentially: polynomial selection, lattice sieving, and linear system solving.

Polynomial selection fixes the number field over which the algorithm is run. The choice of polynomial controls a constant-factor speedup on the lattice sieving step. It’s therefore typically worth spending a fixed fraction (~5%) of overall sieving compute finding a “good” polynomial. There was little technical innovation here; we adapted CADO’s stage-1 polynomial selection to GPUs (resulting in `gps1`), using also some kernel equipment from [msieve](https://sourceforge.net/projects/msieve/)’s well-optimized stage-1 polynomial selection. Polynomial selection is more or less embarrassingly parallel.

The bulk of the GNFS computational effort is in lattice sieving. The goal of lattice sieving is to produce lots (8.3 billion in our case) of sparse linear relations over GF(2), where here (suppressing some details) the vector entries represent the parities of prime exponents in the prime factorization of a smooth number. Lattice sieving is also embarrassingly parallel over work items called “special q”s, but each work item requires performing a large number of read/writes at (for our purposes) [pseudorandom](https://www.hyperelliptic.org/tanja/SHARCS/talks/FrankeKleinjung.pdf) locations in a large array; **handling this was the primary technical challenge in optimizing sieving**.

Ultimately, we pack these relations into a large matrix over GF(2) and use linear system solving to find a linear dependence. At this scale, linear system solving is typically distributed and requires a lot of communication bandwidth; this is available in spades over Infiniband and NVLink. The [block Wiedemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Wiedemann_algorithm) algorithm permits relaxing the communication constraint somewhat, and the particular implementation in CADO-NFS is also susceptible to optimization and running on GPUs, which we undertook. Solutions can be processed into congruences of squares modulo N, which yields the factorization.

Overall, Devin substantially modified almost every piece, including modifying a couple of interfaces:

- A GPU-adapted version of CADO-NFS’s stage-1 polyselect, with components from msieve

- A GPU-optimized lattice siever based on `las`

- An optimized CADO head to handle the workunit volume

- Parallelized and optimized dup/purge and fused merge/replay programs

- A new GPU-optimized block Wiedemann implementation

- GPU-accelerated sqrt

- Associated run scripts


The only untouched programs in the CADO-NFS pipeline were: `cado-nfs.py` itself, `polyselect_ropt` (stage-2 polynomial selection), `makefb`, and `dup1`. We even had to optimize `fake_rels` to get reasonable performance for synthetic inputs of the needed sizes.

N.B. I understand these components only in the same way a mid-level car hobbyist might understand car components: their approximate role in the overall system, their effects on performance, some tradeoffs of making changes, and what good operation and usage looks like — but not the underlying physics, nor how to fabricate the component from raw materials. That’s to say that I do not understand much of the underlying mathematics. I can tell you that polynomial selection provides a constant factor on lattice sieving yield; I cannot tell you how the polynomial is used in the siever. In this field I am far from an expert!

### The optimization workflow

I drove several parallel Devins. Across the 3-week duration of the project, I had an average of 3 and a maximum of 18 concurrent Devin sessions running. These were roughly of two types:

- iteratively optimizing an individual component — designing and running experiments, interpreting results, selecting target improvements, implementing them, and repeating

- managing end-to-end factorization runs on the cluster — exercising the whole pipeline and supporting scripts, revealing the most important inefficiencies (errors, utilization, performance) for further optimization


In particular, Devin handled substantial portions of:

- choosing and tuning parameters for sieving and linear system solving (though using benchmarking equipment that I had to help bootstrap)

- generating/optimizing polynomial selections (again, with varying degrees of difficulty)

- running the iterative optimization loop

- debugging (naturally)

- setting up and optimizing the processing scripts

- orchestrating large-scale computation on the cluster


I interacted with this optimization loop once every couple of hours, alternating with talking to other Devin sessions for my regular work.

Devin Cloud was especially convenient for this workflow: sessions are persistent and independent from my computer, parallelization is straightforward, sandboxing prevents interference between independent workstreams, and sessions can run autonomously for weeks. We already knew that Devin was effective at GPU programming, experimentation, and cluster management for ML-relevant workloads, but lattice sieving and GNFS are fairly different; I found Devin’s ability to generalize here quite impressive.

### Running up the scaling ladder

This workflow permitted an incredible rate of progress that I (and even Devin itself) could barely keep up with. For the first five days we ran up a scaling ladder. By the end of this, factoring a 190-digit number took the same amount of time as a 157-digit number had at the start — a little over 3 hours.

| Target | Start (UTC) | Finish (UTC) | Wall time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C155 (term in aliquot sequence 171648) | 2026-08-14 21:51:50 | 2026-08-15 00:04:58 | 7,988 s (including a 1,412 s gap from head crash testing) |
| C157 (term in aliquot sequence 171648) | 2026-08-14 13:39:58 | 2026-08-14 16:51:24 | 11,486 s |
| C173 (term in aliquot sequence 9708) | 2026-08-14 22:01:02 | 2026-08-15 09:18:48 | 40,666 s |
| C175 (near-repdigit) | 2026-08-16 00:32:51 | 2026-08-16 08:56:50 | 30,239 s |
| C190 (near-repdigit) | 2026-08-17 02:17:16 | 2026-08-17 07:34:56 | 19,060 s |
| C201 (odd perfect number roadblock) | 2026-08-17 09:42:44 | 2026-08-18 01:33:59 | 57,075 s |
| C311 = (179^139 - 1)/178 | 2026-08-18 06:52:44 | 2026-08-18 21:11:46 | 51,542 s |
| C190 (just to startle a Devin who randomly generated a semiprime) | 2026-08-18 22:12:28 | 2026-08-19 01:23:11 | 11,443 s |
| C344 = (11^331 - 1)/10 (odd perfect number roadblock) | 2026-08-31 10:44:54 | 2026-09-01 23:40:44 | 132,950 s |
| RSA-260 | 2026-08-18 12:14:19 | 2026-09-03 01:48:57 | 1,344,878 s |

After factoring the C311 (which was roughly equivalent in difficulty to GNFS on a 216-digit number), it would have been safer to proceed by factoring a 230-digit equivalent difficulty number in order to cross the remaining couple of orders of magnitude. But I estimated that RSA-260 could be done in under a month and therefore had already begun polynomial selection, even though I knew the linear algebra remained significantly underoptimized.

## [What did Devin still need me (or other humans) for?\#](https://cognition.com/blog/factoring-rsa-260\#what-did-devin-still-need-me-or-other-humans-for)

Devin successfully optimized and executed a complex computational number theory pipeline at a scale that previously required considerable human expertise. But I cannot claim that Devin iterated autonomously on the entire end-to-end pipeline. It is interesting to consider what he needed me for.

Somehow, the answer seems to be: still a lot. In retrospect, Devin claims that I sent 82,702 words (502,887 characters) in 3,328 messages across 192 sessions out of 233 used for factoring (totaling 14,450 ACUs). Of these, Devins themselves started 101 child sessions, and 36 received no intervention from me at all.

Devin needed me for executive function, talking through and sanity-checking what it was doing, to wit:

- setting a hierarchy of goals and keeping Devin properly scoped

- recognizing when Devin was doing something unproductive and redirecting (“you don’t need to take that measurement”)

- recognizing repeated inefficiencies in Devin’s workflows (“you can amortize this setup work”)

- pointing out untried directions (“make sure the GPU never blocks on the CPU”, “can you use NVLink SHARP here?”)

- organizing experimental frameworks and results (“do measurements this way and find previous results here, don’t cook up new incomparable approaches every time”)

- catching when Devin prematurely gave up on a direction


While in retrospect I appear to have supplied a couple of specific technical insights, my biggest contribution was probably to handhold the creation of a unified set of measured results, benchmarks, and performance estimators, which evidently were not otherwise going to self-assemble. This enabled Devin to more easily run and understand measurements, and me to understand the extent of progress and where more improvements were needed.

Taking a step back, I also want to emphasize that **this effort would not have been possible without CADO-NFS.** CADO-NFS is an advanced, robust, open source implementation of GNFS that was used in many previous records and also by the factoring hobbyist community. It provided all the relevant techniques, the pipeline stages and their interfaces, and a reference CPU implementation. Using those, I could have the Devin swarm optimize programs roughly independently and compare the outputs with the originals. Like in many other cases, I believe that the human-engineered decomposition of the problem was essential to enabling the agents to make progress.

In fact, I noticed that the further the codebase got from upstream CADO-NFS, the more confused the agents became. This could be attributed to accumulating complexity, but I wonder whether CADO-NFS’s presence in pre-training is also relevant here.

This concludes the technical part of the blog post (except for the appendix, which has far more details).

## [Assorted reflections\#](https://cognition.com/blog/factoring-rsa-260\#assorted-reflections)

What has happened here is strange to me. My name is on the result, but it’s not clear to me how to apportion credit among myself, Devin, the hardware, and the world at large.

For programming tasks, I think of current models and agents somewhat like a sewing machine or a loom. I push it along in some way; it evidently could not happen without me, but neither am I throwing the shuttle by hand. It is hard to say exactly what my role was, although I am confident that it was not nothing. In some glib sense, doing this with Devin was not that different from what would have happened otherwise: I interacted with a physical system much larger than me whose precise workings are obscure to me, energy was dissipated, and the factors resulted.

On the other hand, something clearly new is happening. About three weeks elapsed from first prompt to RSA-260 factors found. The rate evinces a capability overhang whose extent we are only beginning to explore. I think we should not shy away from this exploration. In particular, if a problem can be solved via “just programming”, it seems worthwhile to attempt this immediately.

In the past few days, we’ve also seen some impressive claimed results in mathematics, including a claimed solution to one of the Millennium Prize Problems. I share some concerns about a loss of human understanding. I did not learn as much about NFS or GPU programming as I could have expected to had I done this on my own, though likely more than I would have if I were not using Devin at all. It seems important to figure out how to globally allocate resources to maintain human understanding even when technology enables or incentivizes us to forgo this. At the same time, these tools may allow us to choose where deeper understanding is most valuable, explore further than any individual could previously reach, and expand the set of people who can make meaningful contributions. I see this work as an example in both directions.

## [Appendix 2: Details of the RSA-260 run\#](https://cognition.com/blog/factoring-rsa-260\#appendix-2-details-of-the-rsa-260-run)

### Polynomial selection

Polynomial selection began on 2026-08-18 at 12:14:19 UTC. The search was irregular and a bit ad-hoc; it covered several runs over different admin/admax ranges, prime bounds P, and incr values. Search parameters shifted as benchmark results were produced, and I wasted much search time on unproductive ranges due to incorrect benchmark interpretation. A significant suboptimality of this run was spending too much time in polynomial selection; we could have searched the intended range in 1 day rather than 2.5, and it probably would have been worth it to spend only 12 hours searching less than the intended range.

The four stage-1 runs that produced every trial-sieved polynomial used 15,424 GPU-hours or 643 GPU-days. Their parameters are below:

| # | P | incr | ad range | GPU-hours | Polynomials | Root-optimized |

We trial sieved a total of 22 distinct polynomials, which can be found [attached here](https://cognition.com/documents/c260-polys.tar.gz). We tested the top 5 by MurphyE among those we had available as of 2026-08-19 10:53, which all came from the first two runs, then a further 17 selected as a union of the top 10 by each of four scores MurphyE, CADO’s E, E'sigma, and E'chi2 (from [David and Zimmermann](https://inria.hal.science/hal-02151093v4/document)) as of 2026-08-21 06:08:18, which came from runs 3 and 4.

After trial sieving, the polynomial we went with was:

```

Some properties of this polynomial: degree 6, skew 3,226,459, MurphyE 6.633e-10 (Bf=2.749e11, Bg=1.374e11, area=8.59e18), alpha -9.57 (projective -2.38), side-1 lognorm 73.31, 6 real roots. (c260-r1 in the attachment).

The second-best trial-sieved polynomial (c260-r2) had MurphyE 6.215e-10 and gave 1-2% lower yield. The best of the first five by MurphyE (c260-p1) had 5.674e-10 and gave 13-16% lower yield.

### Sieving

Sieving began on 2026-08-22 at 10:01:12 UTC and reached target at 2026-08-30 07:26:15 UTC; the final workunits were uploaded 2026-08-30 at 07:32:17 UTC. Sieving wallclock time was 189.5 hours = 7.9 days. Sieving parameters were lpb0/lpb1 = 36/37 (candidate `lpb3637`), lim0 = lim1 = 2^31, mfb0/mfb1 = 72/111, ncurves 50/35, A = 33, sqside = 1. Special q range was q = 1.0e9 to about q = 3.91e10 (highest workunit ended at 39,091,320,000) for a total of 632,249 workunits. We used a special q range of 60,000 per workunit so they would take about 10 minutes.

Sieving was relatively drama-free. We upgraded the siever twice during this process, gaining 14-17% performance vs. the start of sieving. Measuring end-to-end workunit times as the median interval between consecutive uploads from one GPU, our GB200s went from 585 s to 486s, GB300s from 586s to 504s, and B200s from 628s to 541s. Overall sieving time was 3,813 GPU-days.

Here’s a chart showing sieving progress over time.

Ultimately, we obtained 13,849,985,589 raw relations for filtering (shy of the 13.85B target because four files were truncated after running out of disk space), which filtered down to 8,298,749,059 unique relations (40.1% duplicates), and 3,991,449 free relations.

### Linear algebra

Dedup/purge/merge/filter took 4 hours end-to-end (after a run crashed 2 hours in) on 176 threads of a 192-vCPU node and produced a 656,182,601 x 656,182,189 matrix with 98,431,741,898 nonzeros at density 150 per row. We gave some consideration to optimal merging and changed the target density over the course of sieving, but ultimately landed close to 150.

We optimized the linear algebra while sieving proceeded. Optimization was turbulent because we simultaneously co-optimized matrix params, solver layout, and code targeting speculative final matrix properties. For representative test inputs, we eventually converged on a few matrices formed using optimized `fake_rels`. This fed back into sieving: changes to linear algebra performance (and departure from trial sieving yield estimates) nudged the relation target a couple of times. It is unclear to me how far we were from optimal overall, but I halted optimization when a 48-hour linear algebra run seemed within reach.

Linear algebra began on 2026-08-30 15:45:10 UTC. Dispatch/prep/secure took 4.4 hours. `krylov` ran 2,564,096 iterations on each of two width-256 sequences (m = n = 512), taking 0.045 to 0.102 s per iteration depending on available compute. We saved checkpoints every 8,192 iterations and kept every fourth one to enable parallelizing `mksol`; we deleted the others after verification. `krylov` was done at 2026-09-02 02:38:14 UTC. `lingen` took 3.5 hours on a single GB200 node with 4 GPUs; multiple attempts were pre-empted so this phase took 7 hours overall. We ran 40 `mksol` ranges across two clusters; each ran on a 2x2 grid (16 GPUs) and took between 82 and 87 minutes. Gather took 9m04s on a 2x2 grid and wrote 64 kernel vectors.

To confirm the correctness of the optimized implementation, which had not been tested on any smaller scale before starting the run, we factored (11^331 - 1)/10 (C344) end-to-end while `krylov` ran. As another check, in parallel with `krylov`, we also ran CADO’s `bwccheck` over every V checkpoint pair. CADO’s normal in-`krylov` check went off about 14 hours into the run; we re-ran that interval and continued the run correctly.

I initially intended the linear algebra configuration to be m = n = 512 and two width-256 sequences on 16 GB200 nodes in a 4x4 MPI grid (64 GPUs each). I had planned on using dedicated cliques, but could not due to the requirements of higher-priority workloads, so proceeded with scattered compute as before. I expected some loss of performance due to running across InfiniBand, but the implementation does not fully utilize NVLink, so performance degradation was not too severe. Unlike sieving, linear algebra requires all of its workers to remain up. Consequently it was fatally preempted frequently and we had to develop a somewhat complex placement script to constantly fit the best shape possible to the available compute.

### Characters and square root

Normally this step requires relatively inconsiderable computational effort, but in the RSA-260 run took 12 hours end-to-end after running into some trouble. Due to the size of the rational product (1.76e11 bits), `sqrt` overflowed the `mpz_t` limb counter and aborted. Devin rebuilt `sqrt` three times (first using GMP’s `mpn` functions and then also parallel Karatsuba on CPU); the version that ultimately produced the factors used GPU-accelerated NTT multiplication and finished in 88 minutes. Factors were produced at 2026-09-03 01:48:57 UTC.
